# Where can I get, not citizen complaints, but locations of officially-reported incidents like crashes? DC Open Data doesn't seem to provide that! It doesn't exist, according to WAMU (2015.08.10): D.C. Lacks The Crash Data It Needs To Pursue 'Vision Zero ...

# These adverse events are rare. What can other hazard identification & assessment methods tell us? Would it help to aggregate bike safety data from many places?
